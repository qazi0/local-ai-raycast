### Send Selected Text to Chat

Grab selected text from any app and send it directly to AI Chat with the text pre-filled in the input.

### Web Search

Give your AI access to up-to-date web information.

- **Tier 1 - Prompt-based** (any model): A heuristic detects when your query needs web results, fetches them via Brave Search API, and injects them as context before the LLM call.
- **Tier 2 - Tool calling** (capable models): The model decides when to search using OpenAI-compatible tool calling. Requires Llama 3.1+, Qwen 2.5+, or Mistral v0.3+.

> Requires a free Brave Search API key (2,000 queries/month). Get one at [brave.com/search/api](https://brave.com/search/api).

### Browse Previous Conversations

Search and resume any saved chat conversation, grouped by time period.

## Setup

### 1. Install a provider and download a model

```bash
# Install Ollama (macOS)
brew install ollama

Or download [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) and use its built-in model browser.

### 2. Start the server

```bash
# Ollama (may already be running as a service)
ollama serve

# Or for LM Studio: start the local server from within the app

```

### 3. Install the extension

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd local-ai
npm install
npm run dev

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't connect to server"

- Make sure your server is running:
  - **Ollama**: `ollama serve` or check the Ollama app is open
  - **LM Studio**: Open the app and start the local server
  - **llama.cpp**: `llama-server -m your-model.gguf`
- Verify the URL in extension preferences (default ports: Ollama 11434, LM Studio 1234, llama.cpp 8080)

### "No models found"

- Download a model first:
  - **Ollama**: `ollama pull llama3.2`
  - **LM Studio**: Download from the Discover tab
  - **llama.cpp**: Provide a GGUF file with `-m`

### "No response" when sending images

- Your model likely doesn't support vision input
- Install a vision model: `ollama pull qwen3-vl:4b`
- Vision models are marked with an eye icon in Browse Models

### Slow or laggy responses

- Local AI speed depends on your hardware - smaller models run faster
- Try quantized models (e.g., Q4_K_M variants)
- Ensure no other heavy processes are competing for GPU/CPU

## Tech Stack

- [Raycast Extension API](https://developers.raycast.com) (React + TypeScript)
- OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` API
- SSE streaming with throttled rendering
- Ollama native `/api/tags` and LM Studio native `/api/v0/models` for rich metadata
- [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/search/api/) for web search
